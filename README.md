This is the demo video: http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTU2Mjk1MjMyOA==.html?spm=a2hzp.8253869.0.0

During the video, it is running on my Mac, without using ZED Stereo Camera.

I used a stereo camera made by myself.

If you want to make your own stereo camera, you need to calibrate your camera and use your own camera parameters.
